                    <h5>ROSAS is a special ecommerce platform developed to cater the transaction between a floral vendor and their customers. Just like any other ecommerce platforms, the customers can browse, add items to cart, buy, and monitor the status of the delivery. In addition, the customers may also edit the bouquet designs provided by the seller. This capstone project also has an administration website, where the seller can add new products, and create new bouquet designs for their customers. It also allows the seller to manage the orders, prepare, and ship them to the preferred location of the customers. The administration website also includes inventory analysis and sales revenue monitoring to help the seller to keep track and control the significant products as well as assisting the seller to make clear decisions from the information it provides.</h5>

                    <h3>T - Spin - R&R</h3>
                    <h5>Emergency response time is very important. It is affected by many local factors, such as a growing population, traffic congestion, and other transportation issues. During emergency situations, sometimes the rescuers find it hard to locate the person in need of rescue. Further delay in emergency response will increase the risk to the lives of many. Thus, we propose R&R: Rescue and Respond, a web and mobile application for self-emergency pinging and locating systems with the integration of Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS). In this proposed study, Geolocation and Google Maps API is to be utilized. We will be using the agile method, namely the scrum framework, for the development process of this application.</h5>
