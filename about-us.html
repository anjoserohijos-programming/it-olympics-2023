                Founded on July 21, 2016, FEU Alabang carries on Far Eastern University’s mission to provide quality
                education in the South of Manila that offers Senior High School and College with programs in
                Accountancy, Business, Computer Studies, Engineering, and Multimedia Arts. In its pilot year in 2018,
                the 1.8-hectare campus has welcomed almost 2,000 students to the 15-storey academic building equipped
                with modern classrooms and laboratories. Accented by lush green scapes, the campus will also feature a
                200-seater chapel and gymnasium.

            </p>
            <p>
                Staying true to FEU’s long-standing advocacy of preserving the environment, FEU Alabang utilizes
                sustainable structures that will use the sun’s orientation and prevailing wind direction for light
                conservation and proper ventilation.
            </p>
            <p>
                With its sixth campus, FEU aims to strengthen its commitment to give their students a complete academic
                experience. Situated in one of the most progressive areas of the South, FEU Alabang in Filinvest city is
                surrounded by multinational companies which FEU recognizes as industry partners. In this way, students
                will have an advantage in securing valuable internships and access to career opportunities. As Alabang
                is also being developed as a hub for arts and culture, they will be exposed as well to global music,
                dance, and art events to complement their education.
            </p>
            <p>
                FEU Alabang is the continuing realization of its founder’s, Dr. Nicanor Reyes Sr., aspiration that all
                graduates of the FEU community will build rewarding careers in professions that benefit the country’s
                growth.
